# Muffaux
Faux Muffalo mod for Rimworld
Muffauxtato works as intended. Good for challeges where players don't want to resort to cannibalism.
Muffauxshroom works as intended. Could not create a Muffaux Meat item without having a Muffaux race due to how Rimworld handles meat. While possible to implement - the race wouldn't have to be implemented in the game world as something that actually instances for the crop to be able to yield the meat - I'm just skipping past that for the easy solution for now. Will probably do that later and create two versions of this mod - one that makes a distinction between Muffaux and Muffalo and one that doesn't make that distinction.
Muffaux tree functions, not as well as hoped. Sprite needs to be adjusted, I can do that later. More importantly the tree cannot be sheared as some would hope, as the tree would need to simultaneously be a plant and a pawn. The tree must be felled for the muffaux wool.
The muffaux tree must be assigned as plantable in each biome. I'm not gonna lie - I'm just not exactly sure how to pull that off without onflicting with other mods. I could probably figure it out but I'm tired and have a lot on my plate tomorrow so I'm just shelving that for now.
